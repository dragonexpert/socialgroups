An extensive plugin for the MyBB Forum Software.

# installation
I cannot make any guarantees the Github code is going to work flawlessly for installs. You are able to create an account for testing purpose here: https://teamdimensional.net/testforums/index.php

1) Upload all files to your forum root directory.
2) Activate from the Admin CP
3) Configure Settings
4) Adjust Templates as desired
5) Create one or more group categories.
6) Create groups if desired.

The templates.json and db.php files are not to be shared outside of this repository.  Users will get that information once they purchase a license and the license has been verified.  I have them included here so you can use it quicker.

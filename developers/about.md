This folder contains all the documentation related to socialgroups.

Some of these files are created by tools such as Visio.  Where possible, I try to provide a screenshot version of the same content in case you don't have a program to open it. 
It should be realized that screenshots are not going to have as much details, but will get you the basics of the diagram.

You are welcome to help provide documentation.

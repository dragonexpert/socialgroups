To use this hook documentation, first import the SQL file into your database.  Then change the prefix of the table to be the same prefix as your MyBB forum.  
Example: tpc_socialgroups_documentation -> mybb_socialgroups_documentation.  You can then view the data in its raw form or you can go to the Socialgroups Module 
in the Admin CP.  This will format it for you and you have the ability to edit it so it makes more sense to you.
